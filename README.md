# NoLBang

DuckDuckGo has an annoying issue that when using almost any bang, you aren't redirected to the actual URL, but instead to a DuckDuckGo search for the letter L. Try it: <https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cat+!w>

However, the actual URL is still encoded in the path - they probably accidentally broke it. This allows me to create an extension that fixes this, though!

## Installation

This is not in any web stores. You will have to clone the repository and enable the extension in whatever way your browser does this. I have not tested this in anything but Edge, but it should work in any Chromium-based browser (Firefox doesn't have a good way to run extensions like this).
